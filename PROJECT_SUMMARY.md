## Key Implementation Details

### Offline-First Data Flow
```
User Action → IndexedDB (local) → UI Update (instant)
                ↓ (when online)
            Background Sync → CouchDB (cloud)
```

### IndexedDB Schema

**Database**: `chikondi-pos` (Version 1)

**Object Stores**:
1. `user` - User profile and PIN
2. `sales` - Sales transactions (indexed by timestamp, synced)
3. `inventory` - Products and stock (indexed by name, synced)
4. `expenses` - Business expenses (indexed by timestamp, synced)

### Service Worker Strategy
- **Cache-First**: App shell (HTML, CSS, JS)
- **Network-First**: API calls with fallback
- **Runtime Caching**: External resources (fonts)

### Sync Strategy
1. **Automatic**: When device comes online
2. **Periodic**: Every 5 minutes (if online)
3. **Manual**: User-initiated from settings
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins (timestamp-based)

## Mobile-First Design
