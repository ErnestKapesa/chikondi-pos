   - Confirm PIN: 1234
3. **Add a product**:
   - Go to Stock tab
   - Add Product: "Test Item", Price: 1000, Quantity: 10

   - Select "Test Item", Quantity: 2
   - Record sale
5. **Test sync**:
   - Go to Settings tab
   - Click "🔄 Sync Now"

## 🌐 Step 4: Deploy Frontend (Choose One)

### Option A: Netlify (Recommended - Easiest)

```bash
# Build your frontend
npm run build

# Go to https://netlify.com/drop
# Drag the 'dist' folder to the drop zone
# Get your live URL (e.g., https://amazing-app-123.netlify.app)
```

### Option B: Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Follow prompts, get your live URL
```

### Option C: Render (Same Platform)

1. **Render Dashboard → New + → Static Site**
2. **Connect GitHub repo**
3. **Settings**:
   ```
   Build Command: npm run build
   Publish Directory: dist
   ```
4. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://chikondi-pos.onrender.com
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Step 5: Configure Frontend for Production

After deploying frontend, you need to update the backend URL in production:

### For Netlify:
1. **Site Settings → Environment Variables**
2. **Add**: `VITE_API_URL = https://chikondi-pos.onrender.com`
3. **Redeploy**

### For Vercel:
1. **Project Settings → Environment Variables**
2. **Add**: `VITE_API_URL = https://chikondi-pos.onrender.com`
3. **Redeploy**

---

## 📊 Step 6: Test End-to-End

After frontend deployment:

1. **Open your live frontend URL**
2. **Create account and add data**
3. **Test sync functionality**
4. **Verify data appears in backend**:
   ```bash
   curl https://chikondi-pos.onrender.com/api/data/summary
   ```

---

## 🔧 Step 7: Enable Auto-Deploy (Optional)

### For Backend (Render):
1. **Render Dashboard → Your Service → Settings**
2. **Auto-Deploy → Enable**
3. **Branch: main**

### For Frontend:
- **Netlify**: Auto-deploys by default
- **Vercel**: Auto-deploys by default
- **Render**: Enable in settings

## 📱 Step 8: Test PWA Features

1. **Open your live frontend on mobile**
2. **Add to Home Screen**:
   - **Android**: Menu → Add to Home Screen
   - **iOS**: Share → Add to Home Screen
3. **Test offline functionality**:
   - Turn off internet
